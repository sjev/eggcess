# LUT calculations 

**DEPRECATED: pre-calculated LUT  has been replaced by `sun.py` modlule.**

These calculations have been used in previous verson, where a lookup table of closing and opening times was pre-calculated.

However, the opton to load custom lut still exists in `timing.extract_floats_from_file`
